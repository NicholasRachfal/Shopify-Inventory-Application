How to run the program: 

Method 1: 
Since I am unaware of what enviornment the reviewer may or may not have, I figured the easiest way to run the application is by using an online IDE. 
I used REPLIT. You can simply run the program after navigating to this link: https://replit.com/@nrachfal/InvenotryApplication#Main.java

Method 2: 
1) Download the Main.java file from my GitHub. 
2) Install JDK using this link: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
   Pick the correct OS your are using for the install
3) Open powershell (if on Windows) or your terminal (if on Mac) and navigate to the directory in which the Main.java file resides. 
4) Type the command 'javac Main.java' to compile
5) Then type the comman 'java Main' to run the program
